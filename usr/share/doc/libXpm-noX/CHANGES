	* Added sxpm-win program
	* Modified simx.h and simx.c so that function signatures

2006-11-16  Charles Wilson

	* Use x.org modularized library (via git)
	* Switch to cygport build framework
	* split into multiple packages

2006-04-18  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* Makefile.cygwin: do not build sxpm
	* sxpm/Makefile.cygwin: remove
	* cxpm/Makefile.cygwin: only build cxpm-noX.exe
	* lib/Makefile.cygiwn: only build cygXpm-noX.dll
	* buildscript: use lndir, not shtool

2003-07-22  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* buildscript: Don't delete sxpm.exe or sxpm.1;
	cygwin-xfree is an official package; sxpm can ship.
	But don't add XFree86 to the requires: list; that 
	defeats the whole point.

2002-01-17  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* sync'ed to xfree86-4.2.0 base
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox-4.1.0.README: removed
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox.README: new file (rewritten)

2001-07-03  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* sync'ed to xfree86-4.1.0 base (no changes)
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox-4.1.0.README: renamed
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox-4.1.0.README: updates
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox-4.0.3.README: renamed
	* include cygXpm-X4.dll in the binary package
	for backwards compatibility -- but don't provide
	import libs or static libs for it.
	* Makefile.cygwin: update VER to 4.1.0
	* lib/Makefile.cygwin: update VER to 4.1.0
	* cxpm/Makefile.cygwin: update VER to 4.1.0
	* sxpm/Makefile.cygwin: update VER to 4.1.0

2001-05-29  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* renamed package to xpm-nox
	* update to xfree86-4.0.3 base
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox-4.0.3.README: renamed
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-4.0.0.README: renamed
	* CYGWIN-PATCHES/xpm-nox-4.0.3.README: updates
	* lib/Makefile.cygwin: no longer build or install 
	X-based libraries
	* Makefile.cygwin: no longer build or install sxpm 
	(because it requires X-based library)
	* lib/Makefile.cygwin: install static and import libs 
	into /usr/lib/noX/, not /usr/lib/.  Use 'libXpm.a' and 
	'libXpm.dll.a' as the installed names, not 'libXpm-noX.a' 
	or 'libXpm-noX.dll.a' because the /noX/ directory 
	identifies them as noX now.
	* cxpm/Makefile.cygwin: only build the noX version now.
	* xpm.h: add ALL_STATIC as an alias for XPM_STATIC

xpm-4.0.0-2 released

2000-11-19  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* xpm.h: Make FOR_MSW and XPM_NO_X synonymous

2000-11-19  Charles Wilson  cygwin@cygwin.com

	* lib/libXpm-X.def: insure that every function
	exported via FUNC() (__declspec(dllexport)) is
	listed in the def file; rearrange ordinal 
	assignment to match what the old linker did
	in xpm-4.0.0-1
	* lib/libXpm-noX.def: ditto
